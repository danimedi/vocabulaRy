# VocabulaRy

This repo is an R package used to use the Forvo API to extract audios for different words to complete my Anki deck about languages. The deck was made through other project, the repo of that project can be found here:

[danimedi/languages_anki](https://github.com/danimedi/languages_anki)

All the audios were extracted from the Forvo app.
