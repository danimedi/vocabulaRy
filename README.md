# **VocabulaRy**  

This repository contains an **R package** designed to interact with the **Forvo API** for extracting audio pronunciations of different words. The goal is to enhance my **Anki language learning deck** by incorporating high-quality pronunciation audio.  

The Anki deck was created in a separate project, which you can find here:  
➡️ [**danimedi/languages_anki**](https://github.com/danimedi/languages_anki)  

All audio files were sourced from the **Forvo** app.

To install this R package, you can use:
